The decision tree model, implemented with clinical data from Hospital Sírio-Libanês using scikit-learn, demonstrates promising performance in predicting ICU admission rates for COVID-19 patients. Achieving an accuracy of 97.87% and precision and recall rates of 90.00% and 100.00% respectively, the model proves reliable in guiding medical practitioners in allocating ICU resources effectively. The interpretability of decision trees enhances trust in predictions and facilitates communication between stakeholders. Moving forward, refining the model with additional features and ensemble techniques could further enhance its performance and applicability across various healthcare settings, ensuring its continued efficacy in supporting medical decision-making processes amid evolving healthcare challenges, notably the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
